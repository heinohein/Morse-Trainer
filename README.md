## **Project: Morse trainer**


The gadget here presented helps you learning the mayor Morse codes. The codes are represented by 
the blinking of a led and showing the current character + a visual representation of the Morse code
on the display.

## **The following files are available:**

- "Doc Morse Trainer, just for fun.txt"		documentation on the project, the PCB, the sketch and
										operating instructions.
- "Morse trainer pcb.jpg"					a picture of the layout of a possible pcb on veroboard.
- "Map Morse_trainer"						contains Morse_trainer.ino, the Arduino sketch.
- "Map Morse trainer pictures"				3 JPG pictures.

## **Prerequisites:**

This is an Arduino based project. You need an Arduino to run it.
You must be able to download the compiled sketch into your Arduino, therefore
you must install a recent version of the Arduino IDE.
See also the file "Doc Morse Trainer, just for fun.txt" for several posibilities/variations regarding the hardware.

## **Installing:**

You must copy the map Morse_trainer and Morse_trainer.ino to compile this sketch.

**The sketch is based on the work of:**

- OLED_ssd1306_128*64_i2c sketch written by Limor Fried/Ladyada  for Adafruit Industries.  
- Morse Code Player Code (Revised By Curt Rowlett)

They are thanked for there examples, which gave me ideas for this project
